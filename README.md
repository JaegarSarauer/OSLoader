# OSLoader

## Introduction

OSLoader is an Open Source Client used to play Old School Runescape. Currently our website is hosted [here.](https://osloader.github.io).

## Things to know

If cloning the repo, I have a gitignore on a Keys file. In order for OSL to run when contributing, 
you'll need to create a Keys.java file in the org.client package with a public static string named CRYPT.
